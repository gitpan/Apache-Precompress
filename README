Apache/Precompress version 0.01
===============================

This module lets you send pre-compressed files as though they were
not. For those clients that do not support compressed content, the
file is de-compressed on the fly.

This module overcomes the overhead of having to compress data on the
fly by keeping the data compressed on disk at all times. The driving
force behind this approach was that I couldn't afford to upgrade my
ISP account to have more disk space. The effective savings on bandwidth
are also quite handy.

This module handles SSI very well. If you just want compressed templates
then you won't need Apache::Filter or Apache::SSI. However, if you want
compressed templates or pages (or both!) then, provided they are installed,
simply follow the example configuration above. Do note, however, that
the savings in bandwidth will be lost as this will be sent uncompressed
down the pipe. This is a todo but will probably involve Apache::Compress
(or something).

Otherwise you will have a normal page with garbled content intermingled 
within it.

More information is available in the POD.
